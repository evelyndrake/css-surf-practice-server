// See influx_chatcolor.txt for info about colors.
// CSS can use #HEX eg. #FF0000 for red.
// CS:GO will have to settle for {NAME} eg. {RED} for red.
//
// Order of ranks in this file will determine the order in menus.
//
// "points"		- The amount of points player needs to unlock this rank.
// "unlock"		- If true, unlocking this will not set player's rank to this automatically. Player will have to manually choose this rank.
// "flags"		- If set, player is required to have said flag to use it. Will hide itself in the menu.
